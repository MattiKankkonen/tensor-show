# tensor-show
This is my hobby/study project for learning web programming and TensorFlow. This is an image processing engine based on MNIST example, for recognizing numbers in pictures. This can be installed on Heroku as such and used by feeding URL for images to be processed. The result can be either HTML or JSON form.

This is currently running on: http://tensorshow.herokuapp.com
Some sample images to feed can tried via this site: http://tensorshowtest.herokuapp.com

This is still very humble beginnings. The algorithm for image recognition is very simple one and quite often guessing wrong. There is no concurrent access support in the web app yet, etc.
